DTL (Data Transformation Language)
==================================

Explainable language for cleaning tabular data.

```sql
WITH a AS IMPORT 'input_a';
WITH b AS IMPORT 'input_b';
WITH output AS
    SELECT key, a.value AS a, b.value AS b
    FROM a
    JOIN b ON a.key + 1 = b.key;
EXPORT output TO 'output';
```
